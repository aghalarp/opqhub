        <p>
                The Community Data Sharing Initiative (CDSI) allows users to opt-in for sharing their power quality
          information to the public. You may include as little or as much information as you feel comfortable
          with.
        </p>
        <p>
                Please note that all fields refer to the location of the device you registered in "step 3".
        </p>
        <p class="bold">Opting-In</p>
        <p>
                To opt-in to the Community Data Sharing Initiative, make sure "Participate in CDSI" is selected. Then,
          for each field that you would like to share with the public, fill it in. If you do not want to share
          a field with the public, leave it blank.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
                When Finished
        </p>
        <p>
                This is the last step in the wizard. Review the information in previous steps and select "Finish" to
          save the changes and exit the wizard. Remember, all of this information can later be edited in the
          "Administration" section of the website.
