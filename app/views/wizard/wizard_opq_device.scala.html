      <p>
        This section allows you to register a single OPQBox. You can register more OPQBoxes later in the device
        administration section.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">Device Id</p>
      <p>
        Every OPQBox comes with a device id. The device id can be found on the underside of your OPQBox.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: 12345
      </p>
      <p class="bold">Device Description</p>
      <p>
        Provide a short description of your device. This makes it easy to differentiate between multiple
        devices your control without having to memorize their device id.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples: Offices, basement, uptown, etc
